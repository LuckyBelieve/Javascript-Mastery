// two types of programming languages
// static programming languages: the type of a variable can not be changed
// dynamic programming languages: the type of a variable can be changed at runtime

// in js we use typeof operator to find the type of a variable
let myName = "Lucky";
console.log(typeof myName);

let age = 18;
console.log(typeof age);
let isApproved = true;
console.log(typeof isApproved);
let firstName = undefined;
console.log(typeof firstName);
